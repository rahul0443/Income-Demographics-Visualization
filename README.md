# Income-Demographics-Visualization

Data visualization-driven demographic profiling using the U.S. Census Adult Income dataset to uncover socio-economic patterns influencing income for non-predictive college marketing strategy.

## Income-Based Demographic Profiling Using Data Visualization

This project explores the U.S. Census Adult Income dataset to uncover socio-economic factors influencing income levels. Through rigorous data cleaning and visualization, it builds an observational, non-predictive framework for demographic profilingâ€”particularly for applications like college marketing.
